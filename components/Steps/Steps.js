				<Card_description>
					By scheduling a short online meeting, I'll be able to give you an
					overview of financial planning and an introduction to the different
					roles in the financial services industry.
				</Card_description>
				<Card_description>
					I will also properly introduce myself as a professional so you'll have
					an idea about my set of expertise, responsibilities, and limitations.
					How I'll be paid and how I'll be held accountable will also be
					disclosed.

					My set of expertise might not be the right fit for the goals you want
					to achieve or the institutions I represent may not be of your personal
					preference. You are not, in anyway, obliged to have me as your
					financial professional.

					In any case, I am grateful to have shared with you the unpopular yet

					I canâ€™t make a sound financial plan just like a doctor canâ€™t prescribe

					Given the wide variety of financial instruments available, finding the

					daunting task.
				</Card_description>
				<Card_description>
					As your financial advisor, I will explain, to the best of my ability,
					viable options so you, and you alone, can make an informed choice.
