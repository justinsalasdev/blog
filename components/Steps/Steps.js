					By scheduling a short online engagement, I'll be able to give you an
					overview of the financial planning. I will also get to properly
					introduce myself as a professional so you'll get to decide if my set
					of expertise will cater to your needs and expectations. How am I going
					to get compensated will also be disclosed.

					My set of expertise might not be the right fit for the goals you want
					to achieve or the institutions I represent may not be of your personal
					preference. In any case, by discussing these matters upfront, we'll be
					able to save significant time and energy that could have been wasted
					if we heedlessly began planning without addressing relevant concerns.

				<Card_description>
					Financial plans are useless if no actions are taken to make it happen.
					Given the wide variety of financial instruments available, it can be
					confusing most of the time to choose which one is adequate for your
					goals. As a financial advisor, all I can do for you is to explain, to
					the best of my ability, viable recommendations suitable to your
					current financial standing - so you, and you alone, can make an
					informed choice.
